/**
 * Class Photos ðŸ“¸
 * 
 * It's photo day at the local school, and you're the photographer assigned to take class photos.
 * The class that you'll be photographing has an even number of students, and all these students 
 * are wearing red or blue shirts. In fact, exactly half of the class is wearing red shirts, and 
 * the other half is wearing blue shirts. You're responsible for arranging the students in two rows 
 * before taking the photo. Each row should contain the same number of students and should adhere 
 * to the following guidelines:
 * - All students wearing red shirts must be in the same row.
 * - All students wearing blue shirts must be in the same row.
 * - Each student in the back row must be strictly taller than the student directly in front of 
 *   them in the front row.
 * 
 * You're given two input arrays: one containing the heights of all the students with red shirts 
 * and another one containing the heights of all the students with blue shirts. These arrays will 
 * always have the same length, and each height will be a positive integer. Write a function that 
 * returns whether or not a class photo that follows the stated guidelines can be taken.
 * 
 * Note: you can assume that each class has at least 2 students.
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * redShirtHeights = [5, 8, 1, 3, 4]
 * blueShirtHeights = [6, 9, 2, 4, 5]
 * 
 * Sample Output:
 * true // Place all students with blue shirts in the back row.
